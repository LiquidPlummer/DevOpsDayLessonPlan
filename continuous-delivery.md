# Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery (Not 'CD', that's Deployment) is a paradigm in which the building, management and testing of produced software is automated such that deployments can be performed at the push of a button.

Continuous Delivery seeks to automate every possible step up to but not including deployment. Continuous delivery is achieved when every change is proven, by automated process, to be deployable at any time. Continuous Delivery depends on CI and is a stepping stone on the way to CD (a fully automated development pipeline). Since we don't include deploying the product we can still preform final user testing, and/or leave the production deployment to a regular schedule.
