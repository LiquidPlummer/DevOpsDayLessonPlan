#DevOps
DevOps, a combination of Development and Operations, is a set of practices and methodologies designed to combine the development (production/writing of code), deployment and maintenance of code into a streamlined process.  
The primary goal of DevOps is to expedite the lifecycle of application development, particularly through the automation of tasks.
